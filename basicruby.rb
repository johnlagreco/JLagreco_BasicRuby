# Create a function that takes a string and 
# adds the phrase "Only in America!" to the end of it

# Create a function to find the maximum value in 
# an array of numbers. 
# For instance: [100,10,-1000] should return 100.

# Create a function that takes two 
# arguments - both of them arrays. 
# Inside of the function, combine the arrays using 
# the items from the first array as keys and the 
# second array as values into a hash. 

# For example, when these two arrays are 
# supplied as arguments:
# ruby [:toyota, :tesla] ["Prius", "Model S"]
# they should return a hash like so:
# ruby {toyota: "Prius", tesla: "Model S"}
